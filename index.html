                                        Speech is the main and most effective way of human communication. Using only words, there is no conveying of emotion in a flat tone. There is a transfer of emotion in every person's speech, even if he is not aware of it. Detecting this emotional state is also a challenge because when a person says "awesome" they may not be implying it. Today, there are devices that determine mood by transferring data from things like heart rate, blood pressure, and blood pressure to a device. <br/>What if it was said that it is possible to detect emotions from facial expressions and voice without needing a device?

                                        The Speech Emotion Recognition system aims to perform emotion analysis only by voice, without the need for a machine. Thanks to this system, this system can be used in many areas in daily life.

                                        <li><b>Customer service:</b> Customer service is one of the most important factors that increase or decrease the value of a company on the part of consumers. Therefore, it is aimed to further develop and achieve the best levels of communication between customers and businesses worldwide. With the increasing e-commerce sector, many people are connected to customer service. Most of the people who connect to customer service are connected to customer service because they have problems. And many customers get nervous or angry while waiting in line to connect. The Speech Emotion Recognition system is also a candidate to be one of the ideal solutions for this scenario.</li>

                                        <li><b>Job Interviews:</b> In job interviews, it is aimed to understand the emotional state of a candidate from his voice. It is important in the process of recruiting people, in the process of assessing human emotions, in detecting lies, and other things like that.</li>

                                        <li><b>Education:</b> Another area that can be used is education. During online education, it can be understood which student is nervous, happy or angry from the voices of the students. In this way, more or less comments can be made about the efficiency level of the course.</li>
